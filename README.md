I’m @UnmadeThoughts, a cybersecurity enthusiast and aspiring SOC analyst with a strong foundation in scripting and software development.
About Me

    Originally focused on internal logic processing and scripting in Java and C#, I’m now pivoting toward cybersecurity and defensive operations.

    Currently deepening my expertise in security monitoring, log analysis, and incident response.

    Actively building practical skills through hands-on home labs and real-world tools like Splunk, Linux, and VirtualBox.

    Excited to expand my portfolio with projects and contributions relevant to security operations and cyber defense.
