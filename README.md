Let's start with some basic information, so we're all up to speed
- Hiya, I’m @UnmadeThoughts
- I do a lot of work regarding internal logic processing and developing Java and C# scripts, though I'm looking forward to expanding that breadth to far more 
    than just IDE related solutions.
- My major focus right now is delving deeper into how file systems interact and interface with one another, but soon I'll be diving deeper into working on larger scale
    projects down the line, so stay tuned for those.
- I'm presently working on a SPINE related project regarding modding Darkest Dungeons Multiplayer (DDM for short). If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me,
    I'd be happy to have the extra hands on deck ^-^
- If you're interested, or if you need anything, you can reach me at any of the below socials
    - Here on GitHub @UnmadeThoughts
